After we have made the [council incident](https://blog.mangata.finance/blog/2022-10-08-council-incident-report/){:target="\_blank"} public and proceeded to [ask Kusama governance to return the stolen funds](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/237){:target="\_blank"} by an attacker back to the Mangata X sovereign account, they have moved the funds (500k USD in value) to an [Ethereum account](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1F2fBA6ec21142cAa05fAa2F8EcA514005B77527){:target="\_blank"}.

We have filed a criminal notice with the police. An investigation on the attacker is ongoing. We have handed over evidence of the IP addresses involved, as well as links to centralized exchanges that the attacker has been dealing with.

Considering the specific actions taken in the attack, using a specific XCM transfer that uses features from the parachain system we consider the circle of possible attackers to be very small. We will use this information in the ongoing investigation.
