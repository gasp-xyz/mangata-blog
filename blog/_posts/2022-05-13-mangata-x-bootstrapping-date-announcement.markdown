excerpt: "In previous days we have been hinting that we want to start the MGX-KSM Liquidity Bootstrapping Event around the time of #TheUnlock. The Unlock is an event on 15th May when 1.1 million KSM, almost 10% of the circul<ating supply is going to be released to the market. We wanted to launch in the following week and give Kusama investors an opportunity to get in early on the upcoming Kusama DEX Mangata X. But the market had different things in mind."

Pioneers,

After a few intense weeks of building we are finally announcing a date for the [MGX-KSM Liquidity Bootstrapping Event](https://blog.mangata.finance/blog/2022-05-09-mgx-ksm-liquidity-bootstrapping-event/){:target="\_blank"}. 

In previous days we have been hinting that we want to start the MGX-KSM Liquidity Bootstrapping Event around the time of [#TheUnlock](https://blog.mangata.finance/blog/2022-05-05-the-unlock-1-million-ksm-released-to-the-market-on-15th-may/){:target="\_blank"}. The Unlock is an event on 15th May when 1.1 million KSM, almost 10% of the circulating supply is going to be released to the market. We wanted to launch in the following week and give Kusama investors an opportunity to get in early on the upcoming Kusama DEX Mangata X.

But the market had different things in mind.

Due to global market conditions, the total crypto market took a downturn from 1.8 trillion USD in value to 1.1 trillion USD within just 8 days. We witnessed the implosion of a stablecoin that carried upwards of 40 billion USD in value. Kusama, already being front-run on the market from the impeding unlock also took a significant dip.

All in all, the market has a lot of things to talk about and attention is everywhere. We feel it is not the right condition to launch the first market on Mangata X under these volatile conditions and with limited ability to grab attention. We have decided to let the current situation unwind and launch the first market after the dust has settled a bit.

**The date for the MGX-KSM Liquidity Bootstrapping event has thus been set to June 6th, 2022.**

We will use the additional time to onboard our first two cohorts of testnet collators onto Mangata X, share the results of our recent audit and create more educational materials on how to use the Mangata X DEX. We have also hired additional team members that will support us during this coming phase of community growth.
