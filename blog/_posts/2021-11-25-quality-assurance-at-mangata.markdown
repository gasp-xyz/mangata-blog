Business continuity is critical on a blockchain. Blocks need to be produced in regular intervals, like a heartbeat. Errors that result in a stalling chain are usually met with a lot of critique. This is why we at Mangata put a lot of focus on quality assurance and properly testing our tech.

In this talk, Mangata's Test Lead Engineer Gonzalo Cerro gives you a look into how quality assurance in a blockchain development environment works:
- How do we test?
- What do we test?
- How can tests be automated?
- And what are the unique challenges?
