Pioneers,

Ahead of the Mangata X Crowdloan we released details on the [30% DEX and 50% Community bonuses](https://blog.mangata.finance/blog/2022-02-18-mangata-x-crowdloan-bonuses/){:target="\_blank"}. We are now opening the linking period. The linking period will last 2 weeks: From 30th March 2022 until 13th April 2022 6am UTC. If you have participated in the Mangata X crowdloan AND you are eligible for a bonus, **you should now claim your bonus** if you fall under one of those categories:
- If you are eligible for the 50% Discord community bonus
- If you are eligible for the 30% DEX bonus AND are so only with a MOVR address

If you are eligible for the 30% DEX bonus via your BNC or KAR address, you don't need to claim it. It will be automatically accounted. Keep in mind that only the bigger bonus counts, so if you are eligible for the 50% and 30% bonus, you only need to claim the 50% bonus.

This post explains how to claim your bonus. If you have any questions, please ask them in our [Mangata Discord](https://discord.gg/mangata){:target="\_blank"} *#crowdloan* channel.

## Claim the 30% DEX bonus
You are eligible for the 30% DEX bonus if you contributed to the Mangata X crowdloan and your address is listed in one of the sheets of [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fgUaiTQrTPtxx8nYPOvKygWr7_zKElNR0xdW_tDBpas/edit?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"}. KAR and BNC addresses will be accounted automatically. If you are only eligible with a MOVR address, you need to link this address to the KSM account you contributed to the Mangata X crowdloan with to claim your 30% bonus.

To claim the 30% bonus, visit [rewards.mangata.finance](https://rewards.mangata.finance/){:target="\_blank"} and follow these steps:
1. Connect your MOVR address via Metamask
2. Connect your KSM address via Polkadot.js or Talisman
3. Click "Claim Bonus"

To link your account, we are asking you to confirm with your MOVR address that the KSM address is associated with that account (meaning: it belongs to you). You will do this by signing a message with the MOVR address. The message will contain your KSM address. This way the owner of the MOVR address verifies that they want to claim the bonus with the KSM address. This linking will not be submitted to any blockchain and will therefore not cost any gas. It is just a signing of a message. We will then check if the MOVR and KSM address are eligible by comparing against the lists in [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y4VWKSOp_WkulqHzVdjI3xelFVynnmfYcwMOPR2qInw/edit#gid=0){:target="\_blank"}. If a link can be made, you will see a success message. Only if you see this success message, we have received your signed message. The linking will only be stored in our database and only for the duration of the crowdloan claim procedure.

Please keep in mind that the linking period ends on 13th April 2022 6am UTC.

## Claim the 50% community bonus
You are eligible for the 50% community bonus if you contributed to the Mangata X crowdloan and your Discord username is listed in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BI3kFFB1Ibd72Nm8JFfzFdKDzf2s3u7UzzdVQp4GcVw/edit#gid=0){:target="\_blank"}. If you are eligible, you need to link your username with the KSM account you contributed to the Mangata X crowdloan with to claim your 50% bonus.

To claim the 50% bonus you will interact with our bot:
1. visit the Mangata Discord
2. Check the users list for the user called "Airwhale" in the "Mangata Team" section.
  ![an image showing the Discord users list with the user named Airwhale being part of the Mangata Team](/assets/posts/2022-03-30-discord-bot.png)
3. Send a direct message to the bot. The bot will check if you are eligible and then ask for your KSM address. (Hint: In order for you to DM the bot, you need to have direct messages from server members enabled. If you see an error after sending a direct message to the bot, check your privacy settings on the server.)
4. Send a direct message with just the KSM address. The bot will check if it is eligible and then respond with a success message.


Only if you see this success message, we have received your linked account. The linking will only be stored in our database and only for the duration of the crowdloan claim procedure.

If you encounter any issues, please message us in the *#crowdloan* channel.

Please keep in mind that the linking period ends on 13th April 2022 6am UTC.
