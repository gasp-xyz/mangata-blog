While building a full-fledged blockchain is an enormous task, it has been become increasingly easier with the support of the Substrate blockchain development framework that also powers the Polkadot und Kusama ecosystems. Created by Parity Technologies, it offers a full tech stack that can be accessed and allows customization to build application-specific chains, like the Mangata DEX.

This allows us to create [Themis Protocol](https://blog.mangata.finance/blog/2021-10-10-themis-protocol/){:target="\_blank"}, a solution for MEV and front-running. Themis Protocol prevents this form of theft by changing the way blocks for the blockchain are created. Mangatas' Lead Rust Engineer, Mateusz Nowakowski, was invited to Parity's tech conference Sub0 to explain our solution and the technical changes we had to make to realize our vision of a more fair trading experience.
