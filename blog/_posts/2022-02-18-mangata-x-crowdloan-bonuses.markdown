Mangatarians,

As was announced in the [Mangata X - Crowdloan Details](https://blog.mangata.finance/blog/2022-02-14-mangata-x-crowdloan-details/){:target="\_blank"} post, there will be a 30% DEX bonus and a 50% Community bonus given out on top of the 6,250 MGX base reward for participation in the Mangata X Crowdloan. (non-stacking, higher one wins)

In this blog post, we give you the details and lay out the roadmap for the crowdloan. If you have any questions, please make sure to read the full post, as well as the [Crowdloan Details](https://blog.mangata.finance/blog/2022-02-14-mangata-x-crowdloan-details/){:target="\_blank"} and [FAQ](https://mangata-finance.notion.site/FAQ-1633a2a816e646f09aa226fe691ee06c){:target="\_blank"}. Most of them are already answered. If your question is still open, head over to the Mangata Discord *#crowdloan* channel to get it answered.

Before we dive in, let's nail down the core principles once more:
- Everyone who participates in the Mangata X Crowdloan will receive 6,250 MGX per KSM contributed. This by itself is a very good offer in our estimation.
- On top of that, we want to kickstart the growth of the network by showing that we care about community members and DEX users who already made a net positive impact on the ecosystem by giving them an additional bonus on top of the base reward.
- Nevertheless, we need to draw the line somewhere and some people will feel left out. Please know that you are still very early and will be one of the first to participate in this new generation of blockchain tech that is built by Mangata. By getting into a crowdloan, youâ€™re becoming part of the community, and may become eligible to future rewards or bonuses. We have a lot of things planned.

## The DEX User Bonus
One key aspect we are looking for when bootstrapping Mangata X is to attract enough liquidity to facilitate higher volume trading. That is why we decided to look for early adopters of Kusama based DEXes and make them a special offer: If you have provided liquidity on Karura, Zenlink on Bifrost, Solarbeam on Moonriver or Sushi on Moonriver before, you are eligible for a 30% bonus on the Crowdloan. That's a guaranteed minimum reward of 8,125 MGX per KSM contributed.

We took a snapshot of eligible addresses and you can check out if you find your address here: (Spreadsheet)[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fgUaiTQrTPtxx8nYPOvKygWr7_zKElNR0xdW_tDBpas/edit#gid=366454164]{:target="\_blank"}

### How will the DEX User Bonus be applied?
- For Bifrost and Karura addresses: The spreadsheet shows eligible parachain and corresponding KSM addresses. Crowdloan contributions made with this KSM address will be eligible for the bonus.
- For Moonriver EVM addresses: The spreadsheet shows the eligible addresses. We will offer a process in a few weeks and ahead of TGE that let's you connect your MOVR address and contributing KSM address in a provable way.

## The Community Bonus
On top of that, we want to reward our early community that helped us build the Discord (this specific words).
