excerpt: Mangata is an omnichain liquidity network with the vision to make tokens from all ecosystems tradable on a single exchange. Built on Eigenlayer and Starkware technology, it features gas-free swaps, prevents front-running and MEV, increases capital efficiency with the revolutionary proof-of-liquidity consensus, and offers weight voting and permissionless third-party incentives. As an appchain building on Substrate, it is not bound by legacy EVM restrictions and optimizes the whole ecosystem around capital efficiency and fairness.
