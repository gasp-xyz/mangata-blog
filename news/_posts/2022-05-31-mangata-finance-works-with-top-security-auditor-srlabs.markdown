After concluding our [record-breaking Mangata X crowdloan](https://blog.mangata.finance/news/2022-02-22-mangata-x-crowdloan-capped/){:target="\_blank"}, we are getting ready for the [MGX-KSM Liquidity Bootstrapping Event](https://blog.mangata.finance/blog/2022-05-09-mgx-ksm-liquidity-bootstrapping-event/){:target="\_blank"}. In order to ensure that the funds of users are safe, we have decided to work with the top Substrate auditing company in the space: SRLabs. [SRLabs](https://www.srlabs.de/){:target="\_blank"} is one of the most trusted auditing companies in Substrate. They have audited top projects like Polkadot & Kusama, Acala and Kilt. The are also the ongoing auditing partner of Polkadot, making them THE Polkadot auditor and premier choice for anyone seeking security audits in the space.

Our changes to the Substrate codebase go very deep, which is why we are requiring the highest level of precision when delivering. We are introducing a production ready solution for MEV with [Themis Architecture](https://blog.mangata.finance/blog/2021-10-10-themis-protocol/){:target="\_blank"}, our changes to Substrate go deeper than those of quite a few projects.

We are working very closely with top experts in the field, have finished important milestones in the [Substrate Builders Program](https://blog.mangata.finance/news/2021-08-18-mangata-completes-first-milestone-for-the-substrate-builders-program/){:target="\_blank"} and have a dedicated [Quality Assurance team](https://blog.mangata.finance/tech/2021-11-25-quality-assurance-at-mangata/){:target="\_blank"} working at Mangata full-time. Working with SRLabs is the next logical step to progress and position Mangata X as the Kusama DEX and Mangata as the Polkadot DEX of choice.

We have worked with SRLabs for several weeks and all raised issues are being properly addressed, which makes us confident now that Mangata X is ready to progress to its next stage and launch the MGX-KSM Liquidity Bootstrapping Event.
